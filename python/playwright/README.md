# Stockx Scrapers - Playwright (Python)

Efficiently extract high-value sneaker and apparel data from Stockx using these robust Python scrapers powered by Playwright. This suite provides automated solutions for harvesting product details, market prices, and search results while navigating the complexities of modern web architectures.

## Overview

This directory contains Python scrapers built with **Playwright**.

## Available Scrapers

- [Product Category](./product_category/README.md)
- [Product Data](./product_data/README.md)
- [Product Search](./product_search/README.md)

## Why Playwright?

Playwright is a powerful browser automation library that offers several advantages for scraping dynamic platforms like Stockx:

*   **Full Browser Rendering**: Playwright executes JavaScript just like a real user, ensuring that content rendered via React or other frontend frameworks is fully loaded before extraction.
*   **Auto-Wait Functionality**: It automatically waits for elements to be actionable, significantly reducing "flaky" scripts caused by network latency or slow-loading components.
*   **Headless & Headed Modes**: Run scrapers in the background for production efficiency or in headed mode for debugging and visual verification.
*   **Context Isolation**: Easily manage browser contexts to isolate cookies and sessions, which is essential for maintaining clean scraping environments.
*   **Speed and Reliability**: Playwright is generally faster and more modern than older automation tools, offering built-in support for multiple browser engines (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
*   **When to Use**: Choose Playwright over BeautifulSoup when the target data is hidden behind JavaScript execution, and over Selenium when you require better performance and more modern developer tooling.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Python 3.7 or higher
- **pip**: pip
- **ScrapeOps API Key**: For anti-bot protection (free tier available)

## Installation

1. Navigate to the specific scraper directory:
```bash
cd product_category  # or product_data, product_search
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install playwright beautifulsoup4
```

3. Get your ScrapeOps API key from [https://scrapeops.io/app/register/ai-scraper](https://scrapeops.io/app/register/ai-scraper)

4. Update the API key in the scraper file:
```python
API_KEY = 'YOUR-API-KEY'
```

## Anti-Bot Protection

All scrapers can integrate with **ScrapeOps** to help handle Stockx's anti-bot measures:
- Proxy rotation (may help reduce IP blocking)
- Request header optimization (can help reduce detection)
- Rate limiting management

**Note**: Anti-bot measures vary by site and may change over time. CAPTCHA challenges may occur and cannot be guaranteed to be resolved automatically. Using proxies and browser automation can help reduce blocking, but effectiveness depends on the target site's specific anti-bot measures.

**Free Tier Available**: ScrapeOps offers a generous free tier perfect for testing and small-scale scraping.

## Output Format

All scrapers output data in **JSONL format** (one JSON object per line):
- Each line represents one product/result
- Efficient for large datasets
- Easy to process line-by-line
- Can be imported into databases or data processing tools

Example output files:
- `stockx_com_product_category_page_scraper_data_20260114_120000.jsonl`
- `stockx_com_product_page_scraper_data_20260114_120000.jsonl`
- `stockx_com_product_search_page_scraper_data_20260114_120000.jsonl`

## Best Practices

1. **Respect Rate Limits**: Use appropriate delays and concurrency settings
2. **Monitor ScrapeOps Usage**: Track your API usage in the ScrapeOps dashboard
3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement proper error handling and logging
4. **Validate URLs**: Ensure URLs are valid Stockx pages before scraping
5. **Update Selectors**: Stockx may change HTML structure; update selectors as needed
6. **Test Regularly**: Test scrapers regularly to catch breaking changes early
7. **Handle Missing Data**: Some products may not have all fields; handle null values appropriately
