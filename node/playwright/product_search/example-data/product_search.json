      "description": "Air Jordan 4 Retro Black Cat 2025 GS brings back one of the most respected Jordan silhouettes in a colorway that has always been about restraint and confidence. The Black Cat identity strips the Air Jordan 4 down to pure attitude, letting the shape, paneling, and proportions do all the work without relying on contrast or loud details. In grade school sizing, the shoe still carries the same aura as the original adult releases, making it feel serious and intentional rather than scaled down or playful.<br><br>What makes the Black Cat special is how timeless it feels on foot and on shelf. The monochromatic approach highlights the Jordan 4’s structure, from the mesh panels to the iconic wing eyelets, giving the shoe a clean and powerful presence. Collectors gravitate toward this pair because it represents a moment where simplicity became the statement, proving that some colorways never lose relevance no matter how trends shift around them.<br><br>The Air Jordan 4 Retro Black Cat 2025 GS was released on 11/28/2025with a retail price of $165",

The white foam midsole encapsulates visible Air for ultimate cushioning.<br><br>\nWhat are sneaker experts enjoy most about this shoe is the rubber outsole with herringbone traction in pods of black, white, and red, accented with a red Jumpman, thus providing traction and echoing the tri-color look of the upper. The Jordan 4 Retro Red Cement (GS) was released on September 9, 2023 for retail price of $150.<br><br>",
