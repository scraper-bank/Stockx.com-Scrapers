## 🛡️ Anti-Bot Protection

All scrapers can integrate with **ScrapeOps** to help handle stockx's anti-bot measures:

- **Proxy Rotation**: May help distribute requests across multiple IP addresses
- **Request Header Optimization**: May optimize headers to reduce detection
- **Rate Limiting Management**: Built-in rate limiting and retry logic

**Note**: Anti-bot measures vary by site and may change over time. CAPTCHA challenges may occur and cannot be guaranteed to be resolved automatically. Using proxies and browser automation can help reduce blocking, but effectiveness depends on the target site's specific anti-bot measures.

**Free Tier Available**: ScrapeOps offers a generous free tier perfect for testing and small-scale scraping.
